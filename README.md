Gb wrap
======

gb wrap is a plugin for gb that adds a very simple wrapping mechanism to allow you to run GOPATH aware tools
It works in the following way:
    gb wrap <tool>

The chosen tool will be called, but the GOPATH environment variable will be set to the correct values for the current gb project
